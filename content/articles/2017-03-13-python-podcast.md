### Learn something new, be in the trend with podcasts. 

And what do you do when you go to work or from work? It is possible to spend this free time with **advantage**. Someone listens the audiobooks, and I suggest listening to audio _podcasts_.

* [Talk Python](https://talkpython.fm/) - the famous podcast about python here. Just listen it ♫
* [Podcast__init__](https://www.podcastinit.com/) - another updatable podcast.
* [Import This](https://www.kennethreitz.org/import-this/) - podcast from Kenneth Reitz. [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) is his library ☺

Update: I found a great article about [Python podcast](https://dbader.org/blog/ultimate-list-of-python-podcasts). Definitely the good article
