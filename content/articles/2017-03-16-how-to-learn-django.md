Sometimes I read [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), and I see that sometimes [Django channel](https://www.reddit.com/r/django/) apeear questions about _how to learn this framework great framework_.
First of all, it must be said that the documentation of Django is very well documented. And they have no less bad [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial01/). It covers the most beginner questions that may arise in your development with framework. Of course, if you need to delve deeper into knowledge, then you need to read the documentation, which, as I mentioned above, is well written.
