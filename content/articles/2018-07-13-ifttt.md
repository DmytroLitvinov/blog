Summary: What is IFTTT and how do I use it at daily life

A few improvements that will improve your django admin application.

One of these days I remembered about such service as [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). Also known as "If This Then That". IFTTT helps your apps and devices work together in new ways.


I discover starter page and found some usefull applets for me.
I dont remember is [Get an email with latest IFTTT updates](https://ifttt.com/applets/i8YQ3XsG-get-an-email-with-the-latest-ifttt-updates) setup by default or not, but it is useful to get latest updates.

The last two is related to [weather](https://ifttt.com/weather). 

Here there are:

* [Cold tomorrow? Notify me!](https://ifttt.com/applets/81321378d-cold-tomorrow-notify-me)
* [Rain today? Don't forget an umbrella](https://ifttt.com/applets/80807030d-rain-today-don-t-forget-an-umbrella)

Since the post is written in the summer,the second applet is more actual for me.
Before rain I get notification to my mobile phone.
It is very useful and at this moment I am trying to find more suitable for me applets.

Stay productive!
Use technology by maximum as you can.
