Each programmer in his life should: learn a git, do a to-do list, and also make a [blog](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/blog). 

If you are python programmer, I recommend you to do your personal blog with help of python.

My current blog created with help of [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) using [Flex theme](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex) 
and hosted at GitHub. 

The main files you should pay attention to are: [pelicanconf.py](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/blog/blob/master/pelicanconf.py) 
and [publishconf.py](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/blog/blob/master/publishconf.py).

Pelican has a great [quickstart section](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/quickstart.html), 
after reading that, you will already have generated the main template for your blog.

I recommend you create repository called 'blog' and push these files to this repo.

So, add content and your blog is ready. Pretty simple, right?
